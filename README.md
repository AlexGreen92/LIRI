# project8 LIRI
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation andRecognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data(also write that data in log.txt file). LIRI  searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this <artist/band name here>`

   * `spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * `movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * `do-what-it-says` (reads command from random.txt file)
